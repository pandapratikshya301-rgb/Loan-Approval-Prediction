# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and loan amount.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Loan approval is a critical decision for financial institutions. Incorrect approvals can lead to financial loss, while incorrect rejections can reduce customer satisfaction.

This project aims to automate and improve this decision-making process using machine learning.

# 🔗 How to Run

Follow the steps below to run this project on your system.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git
```
---

## 2. Navigate to the Project Folder

```bash
cd loan-approval-prediction
```
---

## 3. Install Required Libraries

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
---

## 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook file:

```text
notebook/Loan Approval Prediction.ipynb
```
Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Credit history is the strongest predictor
- Income significantly influences loan approval
- Loan-to-income ratio plays a major role

---

## 🚀 Results
Random Forest performed best among all models due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

---

## ⚠️ Business Considerations
- Lower threshold → more approvals but higher risk
- Higher threshold → safer decisions but fewer approvals
